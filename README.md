# CUDA-powered-mesh-handling-and-Iterative-solvers

Handling upto 2nd order finite elements of tetrahedrals, quadraterals, wedges, triangles and squares.

With CUDA implementations with pyTorch, fast computations of shape gradients, stiffness matrix, mass matrix, surface mesh, mesh face conneectivity etc.

Partially parallel CG solvers are also defined, along with a hybrid solver of iterative and inverse methods with sub-divided mesh, also partially powerd by CUDA for faster computation.
